-- ============================================================
-- reconcile_orders(keep_ids) — delete MIRROR GHOSTS: orders that were
-- deleted in Odoo after we synced them. Upserts add/update but never
-- delete, so Odoo deletions accumulate as extra rows (owner found +11:
-- dashboard 2,034 vs Odoo 2,023 for July).
--
-- Run ONCE in Supabase → SQL Editor. Called by the n8n workflow
-- "Dabboos Orders RECONCILE" via POST /rest/v1/rpc/reconcile_orders
-- with the full list of CURRENT Odoo order ids (2026+). The id list
-- travels in the request BODY, so its size is unlimited.
--
-- Returns the deleted rows (id + name + state) as evidence.
-- Service-role only: the dashboard's anon/authenticated keys cannot
-- call it.

-- safety: never callable with an empty/absurdly small list by accident?
-- The n8n workflow guards this (aborts if Odoo returned < 100 ids), so a
